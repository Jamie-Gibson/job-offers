## Job opportunity:

Vizzuality uses data, technology and design to tell stories that inspire new learning and action on behalf of our environment and our communities. Our international team of 35 designers, developers and project strategists are located across three offices – Madrid, Spain; Cambridge, England; and now in Washington, DC. 

As the second hire in vizzuality’s new DC office (and our first-ever community manager), you’ll work directly with our Vice President, Development and Impact to help build our third location from the ground up. This is a truly unique opportunity to put your stamp on a growing, international technology startup and shape our business and our impact in the United States.

## As community manager, your focus areas will be the following

Community Building through Events and Communications
* Partner with our VP to design and build our DC presence – brainstorming new community initiatives and events to try, identifying speaking opportunities to promote our work, and other local experiments for outreach
* Lead the planning and execution of vizzuality’s signature event, datamovida
* Collaborate with our Lead Writer and other teammates to explore new ideas for blogs, social media and other marketing or communications pieces, and write articles about vizzuality’s work

Supporting the Health and Growth of Our Business
* Research opportunities to pitch our work to new clients or partners 
* Author written proposals and presentations for new business, in collaboration with others across our team
* Help shape our point of view on what types of projects we should be taking on


Rolling Up Your Sleeves to Launch Something New
* Act as ‘right-hand’ for our VP – managing office logistics and other administrative or project-related tasks as needed
* Support the creation of office rituals and traditions as our team grows (birthdays, lunchtime know-hows, and other team building activities)

In this role you’ll need to feel comfortable balancing lots of priorities and deadlines, and managing your time and your efforts to get things done. You’ll also need to be open to learning and experimenting as you go, as well as regularly reflecting on and measuring whether your experiments worked. With most of your teammates located across different continents, you’ll quickly get the hang of collaborating across time zones and platforms to brainstorm new ideas, troubleshoot obstacles, support our clients, and produce high-quality, high-impact work. And in the process, you’ll be helping to grow our work and our presence in DC, as well as our own culture and traditions as we expand our local team.

## You will excel in this role if you:
* Have experience starting something from scratch (for instance a campus club or a volunteer group)
* Are oriented toward community building, customer service and teamwork
* Have strong written, verbal and visual communication skills
* Worked in and/or are eager to learn more about topics like human-centered design, data visualization, technology, and innovation 
* Are interested in working in an international setting and learning about different countries and cultures
